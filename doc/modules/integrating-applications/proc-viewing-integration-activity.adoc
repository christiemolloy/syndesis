= Viewing information about an integration's activity

{prodname} provides activity information for each execution of an integration.
This information is part of the integration's log. 
For each step in a flow, {prodname} provides:

* The date and time that the step was executed
* How long it took to execute the step
* Whether execution was successful
* The error message if execution was not successful
 
At any time, you can view this information.

.Prerequisites
* There is or was a running integration for which you want to view activity
information. 
* This integration has been executed at least once. 

.Procedure

. In the left panel, click *Integrations*.
. At the right of the entry for the integration for which you want to view activity
information, click *View*.
. In the integration's summary page, click the *Activity* tab.
. Optionally, enter date and/or keyword filters to limit the executions
listed.
. Click the integration execution for which you want to view activity information.


[NOTE]
====
For an API Provider integration or a webhook step, the information in the integration’s *Activity* tab reflects the communication between the {prodname} integration and the client that invokes it. Errors generated by HTTP or REST requests are not visible in the integration’s *Activity* log. If you want to view or test the errors generated by HTTP or REST requests, when you configure the API Provider or the webhook step, check the *Include error message in the return body* option (checked by default). Then, you can verify whether the error message is included in the response by checking the HTTP or REST header in the response to the caller. You can also check the integration pod’s log file for `INFO` messages.

.Additional resources
* To obtain additional information between any two steps, you can
add a log step to the
integration. A log step provides information about each message it
receives and can provide custom text that you specify.
If you add a log step, then it appears as one of the integration's
steps when you expand the integration execution that you want to view activity
information for. You view {prodname} information for a log step in the 
same way that you view {prodname} information for any other step. See
link:{LinkSyndesisIntegrationGuide}#add-log-step_manage[Logging information about integration execution].
