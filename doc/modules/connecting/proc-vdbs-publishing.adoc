= Publishing virtual databases in {prodname} to make them available for access

After you define a virtual database in {prodname}, you must publish it to make 
it available for users and applications to access. 

Publishing a virtual database builds the schema definition that you implemented by 
importing data sources and views into a runtime image. {prodname} deploys the runtime 
image to OpenShift as a virtual database container image that you can scale independently. 

After you publish the virtual database, it becomes available as a service and is represented 
on the {prodname} *Connections* page. The service behaves like any relational 
database, and clients can connect to it over standard interfaces. It can be incorporated 
into {prodname} integration workflows, and it is available to JDBC and OData clients.

.Prerequisites
* You created a virtual database in {prodname}.
* You added any views that you want to the virtual database.

.Procedure
. From the navigation sidebar in {prodname}, click *Data*.
. On the *Data Virtualizations* page, find a virtual database that you 
want to publish, click image:images/tutorials/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[Three Vertical Dots] and then click *Publish*.
+
A confirmation message notifies you that the virtual database was submitted for 
publishing, and a progress bar reports the status of the process. 
+
* If the publishing process succeeds, {prodname} makes the following updates:
+
** The status label of the virtual database entry on the *Data virtualizations* page changes 
from *Stopped* to *Running*. 
** The virtual database entry displays a URL link to the OData endpoint for the virtual database.
** The virtual database service is added to the *Connections* page, and a JDBC connection 
to it is created.
+ 
You can verify the JDBC URL by opening the entry for the virtual database service from 
the *Connections* page.       
+ 
* If the publishing process fails, the entry is flagged with the label *Error*.
