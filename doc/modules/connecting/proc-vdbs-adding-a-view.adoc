= Adding a view to a virtual database
:context: vdbs

Add a view to a virtual database to provide a view of the data in a new table. 

After you first create a virtual database, it contains only the views 
that you imported from the initial data source. Add views to the virtual database if 
you want to incorporate data from other tables. You can add views based on tables in the original data source or from other data sources. 
//When you add a view you can join tables from previously imported data sources and new data sources.

// To add a view 
//that merges data from a new source with an existing source, requires you to add two views:

//* Add one view to import tables from the new source.
//* Add a second view to combine tables from the different sources.     

.Prerequisites
* The virtual database that you want to add a view to is available in {prodname} in a _Stopped_ or _Published_ state. 
You cannot use {prodname} to add views to virtual databases that were created outside of {prodname}.
* A {prodname} connection exists to the data source that contains the table that you want integrate.
* You know the name of the table that you want to use in the view.
 
.Procedure 
. From the navigation sidebar in {prodname}, click *Data*.
. From the list on the *Data Virtualizations* page, find the virtual database that you want 
to modify and click *Edit*.
//. Choose one of the following methods to create a view:
//* *Add views for tables in a new data source* 
//+
//.. Click *Import Data Source*.
//.. From the *Import Data Source* page, click the tile for an active data source, and then click *Next*.  
//.. Select one or more tables to include in your virtual database, and then click *Done*. 
//+
//If you select multiple tables, {prodname} creates a view for each table.  
//+
//A confirmation message reports when the import completes, and you are returned to 
//the page for your virtualization. 
//* *Add views from an existing data source* 
//+
. Click *Create a view*.
. Expand a data source to view the tables that it contains. 
. Select the table that you want to add to the virtual database, and then click *Next*. 
//
//+
//If you select multiple tables, {prodname} creates a view that combines data from 
//all of the selected tables. 
. On the *Name your view* page, type a name in the *View Name* field, and then click *Done*.
+
The *View editor* displays the SQL for the view that you created. The *Preview* panel displays 
the data in the view.
. If no data displays, click the *Refresh* icon. 
. Click *Done* to close the view.
+
If the virtual database was previously published, you must republish it 
to make the new view available. 

.Additional resources
* Experienced SQL programmers can also add views by directly editing the default SQL statements for the virtual database. For more information, see
