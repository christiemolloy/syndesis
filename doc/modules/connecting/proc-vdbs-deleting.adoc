= Deleting a virtual database in {prodname}

You can permanently delete virtual databases that you create in {prodname}. You can
delete virtual databases whether they are published or in draft. 

The data sources that a virtual database consumes are not affected by the deletion. Connections 
between {prodname} and the data sources remain in place.    

.Prerequisites

* You have a virtual database that was created in {prodname} and you want to remove it. 

.Procedure

. From the navigation sidebar in {prodname}, click *Data*.
. On the *Data Virtualizations* page, click the overflow menu for 
the virtual database that you want to delete, and then click *Delete*.
. When prompted, click *Delete* to confirm that you want to delete the virtual database.
+
A confirmation message reports when the virtualization is deleted.
